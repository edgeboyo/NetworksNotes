# Computer Networks Notes

* Open ended questions
* Dont get him started on Adobe Licensing
* No need to answer all questions (look at front page)
* One question to answer per section
* S's section is by far the most difficult
* Kirk's Section
  * **Big Blocks of Text** ;(
  * Kirk will be grading his section, so might be worth it to write interesting stuff you've read about
* Section of Cryptography (read up on your old repos)
* Take specific *temporal units* (per day, per hour) when doing math questions
* Read up on protocols, specifically their throughput and power requirements
  * Remember fair use policies etc 
* Try and design systems for continuous use
* Read up research papers on smart cities, for good solution examples
* Read up on already existing solutions (might show up and request specific protocols to be attached to it)
* Questions might be similar to last year's (one was almost 1-1)
*
