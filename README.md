# Computer Networks Notes

* Very open ended questions
* Even when a question is mathematical it might be worth to write down how and why you got to the specific number
* Don't get him started on Adobe Licensing
* No need to answer all questions (look at front page)
* One question to answer per section
* S's section is by far the most difficult
* Kirk's Section
  * **Big Blocks of Text** ;(
  * Kirk will be grading his section, so might be worth it to write interesting stuff you've read about
* Section of Cryptography (read up on your old repos)
* Take specific *temporal units* (per day, per hour) when doing math questions
* Read up on protocols, specifically their throughput and power requirements
  * Remember fair use policies etc 
* Try and design systems for continuous use
* Read up research papers on smart cities, for good solution examples
* Read up on already existing solutions (might show up and request specific protocols to be attached to it)
* Questions might be similar to last year's (one was almost 1-1)
* Read up extra things on security and privacy of protocols and data (stuff that we might not have talked about during lectures)
* Reminder on radio communication solutions and their limitation (unlikely this time around, but worth the read)
* Take a look at question A1 from... *all* the previous years. It seems to show up a lot (with small changes) and it may again this year
  * Since you're reading them, read up all of the **A** section. It tends to repeat a lot. Try and mock them up as well if you have the brainpower for it.
* Read some stuff on IPv4 vs IPv6 and IPv4 exhaustion, specifically
* Mentions of power use, but no specific questions in Kirk's sections
* S's lectures are the main resource for his exam section.
* Last year ~20 people got 0 marks on the exam
