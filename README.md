# Computer Networks Notes

### Note

Keep in mind this was Kirk talking about these section from his PoV, with a little bit of my bias sprinkled in. The other sections might play out a little differently than he mentioned, but I'd still take some notes from it and read up [previous year's papers](https://pastexampapers.soton.ac.uk/) as well.

## General Info
* Don't get Kirk started on Adobe Licensing schemes (they make him very mad)
* No need to answer all questions. Kirk said this year is you pick one question from two to answer per section (each section written by one module lead) but he wasn't 100% (look at front page when you start the exam)
* Very open ended questions for most of the sections
* Reminder that there was a speaker [Tim Chown](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/staff/tim-chown) on the 28th of April and they alluded to that being examinable. Might be worth looking up his previous/current works.
* Give yourself enough time to answer all the questions. This is mostly about *correct* volume so it might be worth it to answer more on a specific question you know more on than try to trim and perfect an answer for 30 minutes. 
* Time given for exam is same as last year so 2h with 30 minutes per question expected.
* Apparently last year ~20 people got 0 marks on some exam sections, because of problems with running exams online. This year this shouldn't be a problem **as long as you read the questions carefully**.
## Specific Exam Sections
* Kirk's Section (A):
  * **Big Blocks of Text** Kirk likes to skim through them and see interesting stuff, but volume is important, so be verbose *within reason*
  * Kirk will be grading his section, so might be worth it to write interesting stuff you've read about to grab his attention
  *  Take a look at question A1 from... *all* the previous years. It seems to show up a lot (with small changes) and it may again this year
  * Since you're reading them, read up all of the **A** section. It tends to repeat a lot. Try and mock them up as well if you have the brainpower for it
  * Read up on protocols, specifically their throughput and power requirements. Also remember fair use policies
  * Even when a question is mathematical it might be worth to write down how and why you got to the specific number. Just the result will not give you many point, even if correct.
  * Pay attention to specific *temporal units* (per day, per hour) when doing math questions. They change even within a question sometimes to throw you off
  * Try and design systems for continuous use rather than one time upload. As kirk said *"Having a design that requires you to drive past a cafe with WiFi isn't good design*
  * Read up on *specific* already existing solutions (might show up and request specific protocols to be attached to it like: *Present a good 6LowPAN system* bascially only has Kirk's network to monitor glacial movement as a valid answer). He did say it's not likely he'll ask a question like this again (it had terrible grades that year), but better be prepared anyway.
  
* Graeme's (?) Section (B):
  * I know Ollie Bills used to write this one but I think it's [Graeme Bragg](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/gmb1m17) now
  * They tended to be more chill, less quantitative, just answering questions on issued with implementation or developing abstract systems with no specific maths required.
  * Might be a little different this year given the switch
  * Read up extra things on security and privacy of protocols and data (stuff that we might not have talked about during lectures, but nothing too complex)
  * Read some stuff on IPv4 vs IPv6 and IPv4 exhaustion, specifically (the guest speaker I mentioned worked on this as well)
  
* Shiyan's Section (C):
  * This one might a remember-a-thon
  * Shiyan's section is by far the most difficult
  *  Shiyan's lectures are the main resource for his exam section.
  *  Might have to math something out for this one remeber my previous notes on *temporal units* for Kirk's section
  * This section might have info on basics of cryptography (read up key exchanges - like Diffieâ€“Hellman - and most used algorithms - RSA, WEP, WPA)
  * Power use calculation *might* show up here, but no specific questions in Kirk's sections (rather just general *which protocol/standard needs more/less power*)
  * Reminder on radio communication solutions and their limitation (unlikely this time around, but worth the read)
